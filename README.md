# Personalization project

Data set: Amazon Grocery and Gourmet Food

Part 1 <br />
Objective: Increase conversion rate from product views to sales. <br />
Comparison of 3 models used for recommender system:
 + Baseline model <br />
 + Neighborhood-based collaborative filtering (KNN) <br />
 + Model-based collaborative filtering with SVD <br />
<br />
Please see part1_submission.ipynb	in folder part I for code to build and train the models
<br />
<br />
<p>Part 2 <br />
Objective: Build our own recommender system.
<p>Recommender system handles sparse and dense data separately:
For sparse data, we combine: <br />
 + Content-based (build our own) <br />
 + Association rule (build our own) <br />
For dense data, we combine: <br />
 + Model-based CF <br />
 + KNN <br />
 + Content-based (build our own)<br />
<br />
Please see part2_submission.ipynb	in folder part II for code to build and train the models
